# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Ratings by Genre

This Dash app provides an interactive bar chart visualization of movie ratings by genre. Itâ€™s currently a demo version with limited features â€” further improvements are planned but not guaranteed. Use it as-is for now.

## What It Does

- Loads a cleaned CSV dataset of movies (`cleaned_movies.csv`), which includes movie titles, genres, and ratings.
- Shows the top-rated movie for each genre in a color-coded bar chart.
- When you click a genre bar, it displays all movies in that genre, ranked and colored by their rating.
- Uses Plotly for visuals.
- Hover tooltips show movie titles with white text on black background for readability.
